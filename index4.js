//Let's say you have a friend who is learning to play the guitar and they ask you to listen to them play. You notice that they're struggling with keeping a steady rhythm. Instead of simply saying "you're not very good at guitar", you could give them constructive criticism by saying something like, "I really like the melody you're playing, but it might sound even better if you work on keeping a consistent rhythm. Maybe you could try using a metronome to practice?" This way, you're pointing out an area where they can improve, but also offering specific advice on how to do so in a supportive way.
